>>> get commands difference

The first command `kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch` is used to list all the pods in the `elasticsearch` namespace. Since there are no pods running in that namespace, it returns "No resources found".

The second command `kubectl get elasticsearch -n elasticsearch` is used to get the status of the Elasticsearch cluster in the `elasticsearch` namespace. It provides detailed information about the Elasticsearch cluster, including its name, health status, number of nodes, version, phase, and age.

To get the pods inside the `quickstart` Elasticsearch cluster, you can use the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch -l common.k8s.elastic.co/type=elasticsearch
```

This command lists all the pods in the `elasticsearch` namespace that are part of the `quickstart` Elasticsearch cluster by filtering with the appropriate label.

@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/OpenShiftEventRouter (main) $ kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch -l common.k8s.elastic.co/type=elasticsearch
No resources found in elasticsearch namespace.
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/OpenShiftEventRouter (main) $ kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch
No resources found in elasticsearch namespace.

prompt: how do i target the cluister amnd the pods

To target the Elasticsearch cluster and its pods, you need to ensure that the cluster is correctly set up and that the pods are running. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Check the Elasticsearch Cluster Status:**
    Use the following command to check the status of the Elasticsearch cluster:
    ```sh
    kubectl get elasticsearch -n elasticsearch
    ```
    Ensure that the cluster is in a healthy state and that the nodes are up and running.

2. **List the Pods in the Elasticsearch Namespace:**
    Use the following command to list all the pods in the `elasticsearch` namespace:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch
    ```
    This command will show you all the pods running in the `elasticsearch` namespace.

3. **Filter Pods by Label:**
    To specifically target the pods that are part of the `quickstart` Elasticsearch cluster, use the following command:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch -l common.k8s.elastic.co/type=elasticsearch
    ```
    This command filters the pods by the label `common.k8s.elastic.co/type=elasticsearch`, which is used to identify the Elasticsearch pods.

If you still see "No resources found" messages, it may indicate that the Elasticsearch cluster is not properly set up or that there are issues with the deployment. In such cases, you may need to review the Elasticsearch operator logs and the cluster configuration.

4. **Describe the Elasticsearch Resource:**
    To get more detailed information about the Elasticsearch resource, use the following command:
    ```sh
    kubectl describe elasticsearch quickstart -n elasticsearch
    ```
    This command provides detailed information about the `quickstart` Elasticsearch cluster, including events and any potential issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to target the Elasticsearch cluster and its pods effectively.

To search inside the running pods, you can use the following steps:
1. **Get the Pod Names:**
    First, list the pods in the `elasticsearch` namespace to get their names:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n elasticsearch
    ```

2. **Execute a Command Inside a Pod:**
    Use the `kubectl exec` command to run a search command inside one of the running pods. Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the pod you want to search inside:
    ```sh
    kubectl exec -n elasticsearch <pod-name> -- <command>
    ```
    For example, to search for a specific term in the logs, you can use:
    ```sh
    kubectl exec -n elasticsearch <pod-name> -- grep "search-term" /path/to/log/file
    ```

3. **Use `kubectl logs`:**
    Alternatively, you can use the `kubectl logs` command to search through the logs of a specific pod:
    ```sh
    kubectl logs -n elasticsearch <pod-name> | grep "search-term"
    ```

By following these steps, you can search inside the running pods in the `elasticsearch` namespace.
